                    <p>First just to clarify, this hard stands for "it's hard to think of a name". I just want to say that I have a lot of passion in a range of
                        interest I have and I am dedicated to them. I love solving intellectually challenging questions, I love playing basketball, I love playing 
                        video games, I love this world!

                    <h3>Data Science</h3>
                    <p>I have been working on various projects involving data science, more specifically, I have been working on one project focusing on clustering algorithms and another one focusing on data-forecasting. For these two projects, I played roles as a member and a leader respectively. I really enjoy finding out the treasure that is hidden in the data and digging them up with machine learning methods. I have taken Data Visualization (QSS17), Machine Learning (CS74), and Probability and Statistical Inferences (MATH40) which enable me to dive deeper into data science and I keep learning and enjoying!

                    <h3>Development</h3>
                    <p>Since I was a kid, I have always been interested in making my own things. With the help of technology, I have gradually gained interest in developing stuff with my laptop (it did cost me some money so better make use of it). As you can see, I build this website from scratch with some tutorials and I also built a black-jack simulation model with three other teammates which ended up winning the class tournament! Guess I will put that on my resume :)

                    <h3>Communications</h3>
                    <p>I am really good with people and I enjoy being around people to offer help and build friendships. I tutored kids with SAT for a couple of months as a part-time internship and I was glad to see many of them success. I am also currently a student manager at one of the student centers at Dartmouth and, according to my observation, people have been happy at the center so guess I am doing alright.

                <p>Hi there! I am Billy, currently a Sophomore at Dartmouth College. Recently I have been studying probability and statistics, cryptography, and machine learning. I have also been working out, hooping, and developing this website. I hope you can have some fun visiting my website and I will make it more fun after I am done with my midterm, I promise!
                </p>
                <p>More insight into myself is that I picked up my computer science major completely by accident: I was about to take a sports analytics class that was full, so I got kicked out, and I said, well, I need another class to take then, what should I do? My good friend, my current roommate, recommended me to take CS1 with him and I was like, sure, I was planning on taking it in the future anyways. I was blown away by the computing power my laptop has which I have only been using to play games and stuff.
